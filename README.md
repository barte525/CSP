# Abstract csp algorythm with backtracking, forward checking and two heuristics.
With additional:
- Implemented constrains for futoshiki and binary problems
- Sample data for those problems and methods for reading the files in this format
- Drawing charts for time and visited nodes for the sample data, with easy parameterized: Problem, Heuristic, backtracking/forward checking
Implemented with typing for static type checking.
